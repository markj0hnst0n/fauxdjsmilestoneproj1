## Wireframes

Basic wireframes for this project were created using Balsamiq and you can find a link to the balsamiq project file [here](https://github.com/markj0hnst0n/fauxdjsmilestoneproj1/blob/master/wireframes/faux_djs_website_wireframes.bmpr)

## Colour Scheme

A simple colour scheme was intended for this project as the design was to look minimal, also a moodboard of different photos was requested form the client to gain an understanding of the atmosphere they wanted to create with the site.
On consultation with the client a dusky lavender pink background [colour](http://hex.wikimix.info/en/color-dd85d7) was selected to stand out visually in comparison to other websites and also
visually and also to match the colour scheme of the photos that were selected to use for the project.

Initially a light blue font colour was chosen to contrast against the pink background but this was found to score low on accessibility on google lighthouse for users with visual impairments so black was selected as the main font colour for
easier reading by all users.

### Debugging information

Bug: Couldn't center logo on bootstrap navbar.

Debug: Set navbar postion to relative and logo position to absolute.  Didn't end up using this though as it made index.html feel unbalanced.

Bug: fixed-top bootstrap class made content unviewable on all pages.

Debug: adjusted margin-top and margin-bottom on all pages so that content was viewable again.

Bug: After commit 28 Google Lighthouse Audit identified that iframes had no titles from embedded soundcloud and spotify code on audio.html.  

Debug: Added iframe titlesfor better accessibility on screenreader.

Bug: google lighthouse identified this these cross-origin links unsafe destinations in soundcloud links on audio.html.

Debug: added rel="noopener” to target=“_blank”.  Amended this on index.html, dates.html and contact.html also as all social media links included target=“_blank”

Bug: After commit 27 w3c html code checker returned errors for css being used inline to style width for embedded soundcloud and spotify code on audio.html.  

Debug: Fixed this by using a bespoke class and amending style.css with the relevant code.

Bug: frameborder and scrolling in embedded code as this also returned errors in w3c html editor.  

Debug: Removed them as they are obselete elements 

Bug: w3c returned errors as some img did not have alt tags.

Debug: Added alt tags to img tags identified as also causing errors.

Bug: Dates.html had an error in w3c validator as a h2 tag was used in a table. 

Debug: h2 tag removed and used more suitable tag

Bug: Previously warning was returned on w3c validator as was showing that file could not be mapped in xml due to hypens being used more than twice in a row.

Debug: Amended html comments so that it is now mappable in xml files.  

Bug: Section on homepage had no heading element so made site less accessable to visually impaired users

Debug: Added h2 child to section element on homepage to make page more descriptive to visually impaired users. 

Bug: Date and time input types for form are not supported in firefox and safari respectively.

Debug: Amended contact.html form to take away these and used text types and placeholder info to guide users.

Bug: Links did not open in new window on dates page.

Debug: added target"_blank" to links to make them open in new window.

My main influence for this site was simplicity.  Every element must have a function and it must work well.

I took layout pointers from the following websites.

I also looked at the following website for some guidance on the 'dates' page:
